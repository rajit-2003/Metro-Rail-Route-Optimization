🚀 Project Title: AI-Powered Route Optimization and Navigation Assistant
Overview:
This project is a real-time, AI-enhanced route optimization system that calculates the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a network. It combines classical pathfinding algorithms like Dijkstra’s Algorithm with Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities to enable natural language-based routing, dynamic queries, and interactive visual guidance.

🧠 Key Features:
✅ Shortest Path Calculation using Dijkstra’s Algorithm
Efficiently computes the minimum cost paths from a selected source node to all others in a weighted graph.

🗺️ Interactive Graph Visualization
Users can view nodes and edges, interact with them, and see the optimized path in real time.

💬 LLM-Based Natural Language Query Interface
Integrated with a Language Model (like ChatGPT or similar) that allows users to ask:

“What’s the shortest path from Node A to D avoiding Node B?”

“Suggest alternate routes if there's a blockage on C.”

“Explain why this path is the best.”

🔄 Dynamic Graph Updates via Chat
Users can modify the graph by typing commands like:

“Add a new edge between node E and F with weight 7”

“Remove node C from the graph”
The AI parses these instructions and updates the visualization and path accordingly.

🎯 Conversational Routing Assistant
Acts like a smart assistant — guiding the user step-by-step via messages:

“Start at Node A. Go to Node B via road X. Then take the left to Node D.”

🧩 Modular Design
The entire system is built modularly — Dijkstra in JS for frontend logic, LLM integration via REST API, and scope to plug into real traffic datasets or GPS systems.

🧪 Technologies Used:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for UI + Dijkstra visualization)

Backend/AI: Python (FastAPI), OpenAI API / LLM engine for natural language understanding

Graph Engine: Dijkstra’s Algorithm (custom-built in JavaScript for live updates)

Visualization: Canvas / SVG elements for drawing the graph

State Management: JSON-based internal graph state for AI interaction

🤖 Real Use-Case Scenarios:
AI Navigation Tool: Could be deployed as an intelligent routing assistant for logistics or smart cities.

EdTech / Learning: Useful for teaching algorithms interactively using LLM explanations.

Disaster Management: Can help users find alternate safe routes via natural language commands in emergency cases.
